Welcome to the spark documentation.

If you'd like to know more information about what spark is, or want to download it, please visit the [project homepage](https://spark.lucko.me/).

Otherwise, you're (probably) in the right place! A list of available pages are in the sidebar to the left.

The docs content is [**open source**](https://github.com/lucko/spark-docs), and we would greatly appreciate contributions if you think something is missing or could be improved!

Hopefully you find the information you need, enjoy! ❤️
